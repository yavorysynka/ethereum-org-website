# Language Support {#language-support}

Ethereum is a global project, and it is critical that Ethereum.org is accessible to everyone, regardless of their nationality or language. Our community has been working hard to make this vision a reality.

## Ethereum.org Translation Program {#ethereum-org-translation-program}

Interested in translating? Get involved! We're seeking volunteers to join 100+ community members who are working to translate the website into 20+ languages. Here's how:

1. Follow [this invite link](https://crowdin.com/project/ethereumfoundation/invite) to join our project on CrowdIn.

2. You will need to create a CrowdIn account if you don't already have one. Here's [documentation on how to use CrowdIn](https://support.crowdin.com/online-editor/).

3. Find the language and select the document you want to participate in. If translation progress is below 100%, please contribute! Don't see your language listed? [Open an issue here](https://github.com/ethereum/ethereum-org-website/issues/new/choose).

4. Once you've completed the translation (i.e. all files display 100%), our professional translation service will review (and potentially edit) the content. Once the review is complete (i.e. review progress is 100%), we will add it to the website.

Do you have any questions? Please join our [Slack workspace](https://join.slack.com/t/ethtranslation/shared_invite/enQtODQzNTM0ODEzMjUzLTM3ZTg1ZjkxNDFjY2ZiOGNlM2M0ZmNhZmVmMjI3NGM5OWE4YjhhZTdkYmVkZThiNzVmM2JlYzM3NTA5NjVmNTE) workspace and comment in the **#\_support** channel. Feel free to collaborate with other contributors by joining language channels.

Thank you for your participation in the [ethereum.org](/) Translation Program! ðŸ¦„

## Ethereum Community Translation Program {#ethereum-community-translation-program}

We're also undertaking an initiative to translate Ethereum content beyond ethereum.org! Are you interested in translating valuable Ethereum content from authors across the community? Please follow [this invite link](https://crowdin.com/project/contents-translation/invite) to join this separate project on CrowdIn. From there, follow the same steps outlined above.

If there's Ethereum-related content you'd like to see translated, please [let us know on Twitter](https://twitter.com/ethdotorg)!
